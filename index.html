      <h2>As a child I had a ‘VTech Kids’ laptop computer.</h2>

  <p id="p1">It had a program that took directions (as well as other commands) and a “turtle” would move, drawing a pattern based on the commands it was given. I remember how excited I felt when I discovered the beautiful fractal patterns I could create using certain sequences of instructions and, during school, I would write down new combinations of commands and hurry home afterwards to test the new “code” I had come up with. Since that age, I have always had a fascination with technology, computers, and video games. However, while growing up, I found I was never quite able to decide what it is I wanted to do. After leaving school I found a job in a kitchen and before I knew it I was working as a chef.</p>
  <p id="p2">Then 2020 started. I was in a job I no longer had a passion for and not earning enough money to afford my own place. Having conversations with friends about my aspirations to discover a new career, I learned that a friend’s brother had completed a coding bootcamp and was now in a job he loved, working on exciting projects, and earning good money to go along with it. Considering this later, I found myself reminiscing about my childhood. A younger me with a toy laptop, an excitement for technology, and a desire to learn.</p>
