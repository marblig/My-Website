            <p class="mainP">It had a program that called ’Turtle’ which took directions (as well as other commands) and the “turtle” would move, drawing a pattern based on the commands it was given. I remember my excitement upon discovering the fractal patterns I could create using certain sets of instructions and, during school, I would write down new combinations of commands and hurry home afterwards to test the new “code” I had come up with. Since that age, I have always had a fascination with technology, computers, and video games. However, while growing up, I found I was never quite able to decide what it is I wanted to do. After leaving school I found a job in a kitchen and before I knew it I was working as a chef.</p>
            <img id="me" src="img/meBW.png" alt="a B&W picture of me">
            <p class="mainP">Then 2020 began. I was in a job that I had never truly been passionate about and which didn’t pay enough for me to afford my own place. Having conversations with friends about my aspirations to start a new career, I learned that a friend’s brother had completed a coding bootcamp and was now in a job he loved, working on interesting projects, and earning good money to go along with it. Considering this, I found myself reminiscing about my childhood. A younger me with a toy laptop, an excitement for technology, and a desire to learn. My interest was piqued and I began looking into software development and if it was something that was right for me.</p>

        <section id="mainText2">
            <p class="mainP">After sending out a few applications I was invited to an interview with the same program my friend’s brother had graduated from, during which I learned that their funding system had changed and I would have to pay for the course upfront. Now, I live with my mum and brother in the same two bedroom council flat we grew up in, so this - needless to say - was not a possibility. I asked my friend Daniel for advice as someone who works in tech and has a working knowledge of JavaScript. He began tutoring me in the fundamentals and introduced me to Founders & Coders as an option I could look into. During the following weeks I set about learning as much as I could, completing the freeCodeCamp modules and doing my own research on the program and how I could fit into it.</p>
            <p class="mainP">The philosophy of FAC resonated with me immediately. A group providing a means for an education without tuition fees, who are committed to diversity and equal opportunity, is definitely something I want to be a part of. Reading through the ’Stories’ section of the website, I found myself considering new directions I could explore. Searching for junior developer roles previously, I was mostly uninspired by what I found. However, after reading some of the experiences of people involved with FAC, I began considering much more rewarding endeavours, having thoughts like “I could teach” and “I could work for non-profit organisations”. I had reached a new level of enthusiasm for my ambition to learn, and I was more motivated than ever to make those ideas a reality.</p>
            <p class="mainP">Last year I discovered a new passion in the possibilities of software development and I made the decision that I want that passion to be my job. I can’t imagine a better way for me to start that career than with a group who share my altruistic outlook. I wish to join Founders & Coders in order to be a part of that environment. An environment of teamwork and collaboration, and an environment in which I feel I can learn, while making connections and supporting others. The prospect of my future excites me more than ever and I know that through this program I can achieve my ambitions and begin the next chapter of my life.</p>

            <p class="mainP">Thank you for considering my application :) The idea behind the game was a way to improve typing speed, seeing as that’s what coding is, mostly. I also want to give a special mention to my good friend and mentor, Daniel. He has been an amazing tutor over the last year and is most of the reason why you are reading this at all. Anyway, thanks again and all the best!</p>
